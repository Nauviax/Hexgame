WIP puzzle game inspired by Hexcasting. 
Currently the casting system is fully functional, though the UI and graphics are incomplete. Additionally, there are only a couple of working puzzles to solve.
Should be runnable by cloning this repo and opening via the Godot editor.

Web build seems to have scaling issues currently, will look into fixing at some point.
