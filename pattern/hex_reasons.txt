--Akashic Patterns-- (Maybe?)

------------------------------------------------------------

Basic Patterns

	Compass' Purification II (entity → vector) REMOVED
		Removed due to 2D. Eye vs feet has no difference.

	Stadiometer's Prfn. (entity → num) REMOVED
		Height of entity seems irrelevant in 2D


Number Literals
	
	- None -

Mathematics

	Vector Exaltation -> Vector Distillation
	Vector Disintegration -> Vector Decomposition
		2D coords instead of 3D
	Division Distillation
		Vector2 on Vector2 returns Z of resulting vector assuming Z = 0 for input Vector"3"s

Constants

	Vector Reflections
		All now return 2 long vectors (2D)
		Pattern for y REMOVED (The straight one)
		Pattern for z now gives [0,1] (Effectively now y)

Stack Manipulation

	- None - (Swindler's Gambit sucks tho, hexbook has github code)

Logical Operators

	- None -

Entities

	Old categories removed. Based on final flick on pattern, new categories are as follows:
		R: -none-    (Living old)
		r: Friendly  (Player old)
		s: Neutral   (Item old)
		l: Hostile   (Monster old)
		L: -none-    (Animal old)
	Removed categories are invalid patterns, but may be implemented later.

List Manipulation

	Derivation Distillation -> Derivation Decomposition
		I think this was a mistake on the original hexcasting docs. I plan to ask later.
		Decomposition is correct for 1 -> 2 iotas.

	Selection Exaltation
		Reversed upper and lower bounds gives [] not sublist.
		Matches Hex Studio, not base Hexcasting. [] gives more functionality though.

Escaping Patterns

	Consideration no longer pushes a single pattern, but a one long list containing it's pattern

	(This change of representing single pattern iotas will be present everywhere)

Reading and Writing

	Of note, as player offhand is fixed, Auditor's patterns will be less useful. (Outside of some edgecases anyway)
	Both the read and write patterns now report it's readability/writeability from an exterior caster.
		- That is to say, the caster can always read/write to itself, though other casters may not have access to this caster.

	Truenames aren't really a thing here. You can save any entity reference anywhere.
		- As this feature normally existed to prevent players abusing truenames, it isn't needed in this singleplayer game.
		- Entity references will still become <null> when they become invalid, such as leaving a level, or killing said entity. (!!!)

Advanced Mathematics

	- None -

Sets

	Outputs from set patterns are now sets. 
	- This differs from base hexcasting where a specific input with duplicates causes the output to also contain duplicates.

Meta-Evaluation*

	Iris's Gambit left out for now, as I don't think I properly understand it as of right now.
	Come back to it once I get a solid definition of "Jump" iota usage. (!!!)


------------------------------------------------------------

Addons

	Hexal Math (3)
		Factorial Purification
		Running Sum Purification
		Running Product Purification

		Mainly for the running sum as it makes getting a list 1-10 very easy.
		The others to form the full set really. Someone might use them.	

	-- Considering adding Particles (vec | [vec] →) from Hexal, purely for fun --
	-- Wisps? Long term goal? --


My Patterns
	Spellbook slot selection (4)
	Added to interact with spellbook (As it is permanently in "offhand")
		Verso's Gambit, Turn spellbook left
		Recto's Gambit, Turn spellbook right
		Tome's Reflection, See spellbook size (ret num)
		Tome's Gambit, Goto spellbook page (num)
