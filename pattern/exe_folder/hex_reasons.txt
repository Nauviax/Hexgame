!!! WORRIED ABOUT CLONING LISTS, REFERENCES AND ALL THAT !!!
Add stack scan check for same list reference in stack warning
!!! Include metalist for patterns !!!
Most cloning happens in Stack Manipulation, also check list manip tho

--Spell Circle Patterns--
--Akashic Patterns--

------------------------------------------------------------

Basic Patterns

	Compass' Purification II (entity → vector) REMOVED
		Removed due to 2D. Eye vs feet has no difference.

	Stadiometer's Prfn. (entity → num) REMOVED
		Height of entity seems irrelevant in 2D


Number Literals
	
	- None -

Mathematics

	Vector Exaltation -> Vector Distillation
	Vector Disintegration -> Vector Decomposition
		2D coords instead of 3D
	Division Distillation
		Vector2 on Vector2 returns Z of resulting vector assuming Z = 0 for input Vector"3"s

Constants

	Vector Reflections
		All now return 2 long vectors (2D)
		Pattern for y REMOVED (The straight one)
		Pattern for z now gives [0,1] (Effectively now y)

Stack Manipulation

	- None - (Swindler's Gambit sucks tho, hexbook has github code)

Logical Operators

	- None -

Entities* ???

	_ NOT SURE HOW TO TACKLE THIS, COME BACK TO LATER IN DEVELOPMENT _

List Manipulation*
	!!! WORRIED ABOUT CLONING LISTS, REFERENCES AND ALL THAT !!!

	Note that Pattern_Metalist should support many of these operations, so check for is Vector2 AND is Pattern_Metalist
	LOTS OF DUPES, consider manual creation of files.

Escaping Patterns

	Consideration no longer pushes a single pattern, but a one long list containing it's pattern

	(This change of representing single pattern iotas will be present everywhere)
